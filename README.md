# TPMS2STEP

- By Yaonaiming Zhao and Qiang Zou (built on top of Charlie C. L. Wang's MeshWorks)
- Latest Release: 2024.06.21

This tool can translate Triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) microstructure models to STEP files, the standard data exchange format of CAD/CAM/CAE. It also provides the following features: 
- Error-controlling: the tool can ensure that all translated STEP models are below a given error threshold;
- Continuity-preserving: the tool can preserve the C2 continuity among surfaces of a TPMS model after translation.

## !important
The source code was developed as a byproduct of the projects and methods presented in [1].

It can be compiled with GCC 11.4.0+CUDA 12.2, and run on the operating system Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Windows, Mac, and other compilers should also work.

3.Installing & Compiling (Ubuntu+QT 6.2.4+GCC 11.4.0)
-------------------------------------------

This project could be compiled by CMake (version>=3.18).

```shell
cd TPMS2STEP
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make -j 4
```

4.Usage
-------

- After the compilation you can run the executable file TPMS2STEP inside the ./build directory.
- While running this software, you can choose the type of TPMS: 1 for Gyroid, 2 for Diamond, and 3 for SchwarzP.
- You can also change the number of TPMS units, the tolerance, and the offset values. The APIs are:

```c++
void setCellNumbers(int, int, int); // set the number of TPMS units for x,y,z directions
void setOffsetValue(float, float); // set the offset values
void setTolerance(float); // set the tolerance
```

5.File format
-------------

- The output files are <code>.STEP</code> format which can be directly utilized for further design, analysis, and manufacturing in modern CAD/CAE/CAM software packages like Simens NX and CATIA.
